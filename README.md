## Instructions and README.md from generated code -- "How to Play"

- Player 1 controls the left paddle using the 'W' and 'S' keys.
- Player 2 controls the right paddle using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.
- The game starts as soon as it is run. Press 'Enter' to pause and unpause the game.
- A player scores a point when the ball reaches the opponent's end of the screen.
- The game can be restarted by pausing and then unpausing the game.

Given the requirements and assumptions, the following classes and methods will be necessary:

1. `Paddle` class: Represents a player's paddle. It will have methods to move the paddle up and down.
2. `Ball` class: Represents the ball. It will have methods to move the ball and detect collisions with the paddles and walls.
3. `Game` class: Represents the game itself. It will have methods to start, pause, and restart the game, update the game state, and render the game.
4. `Main` class: The entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game loop.
Now, let's proceed with the implementation of each class.
