Before proceeding, I would like to clarify the following assumptions:\n\n1. Paddle Movement: The paddles will move at a moderate speed, and they will move continuously as long as the player is pressing the corresponding key.\n2. Bouncing Ball: The ball will start at a moderate speed and its speed will increase slightly each time it hits a paddle.\n3. Scoring Logic: A point will be scored by a player when the opponent fails to hit the ball with their paddle and the ball reaches the opponent's end of the screen.\n4. Collision Detection: When the ball hits a paddle, it will bounce back in the opposite direction. When it hits the top or bottom wall, it will bounce back while maintaining its horizontal direction.\n5. Graphical Interface: The game interface will be simple, with a black background, white paddles and ball, and white text for the scores.\n6. Controls: The game will start, pause, and restart with the 'Enter' key. The paddles will be controlled by the 'W' and 'S' keys for the first player, and the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys for the second player.\n7. Multi-threading: The game logic and the game rendering will be handled in separate threads to ensure smooth gameplay.\n8.
