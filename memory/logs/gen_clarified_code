Bouncing Ball: The ball will start at a moderate speed and its speed will increase slightly each time it hits a paddle.\n3. Scoring Logic: A point will be scored by a player when the opponent fails to hit the ball with their paddle and the ball reaches the opponent's end of the screen.\n4. Collision Detection: When the ball hits a paddle, it will bounce back in the opposite direction. When it hits the top or bottom wall, it will bounce back while maintaining its horizontal direction.\n5. Graphical Interface: The game interface will be simple, with a black background, white paddles and ball, and white text for the scores.\n6. Controls: The game will start, pause, and restart with the 'Enter' key. The paddles will be controlled by the 'W' and 'S' keys for the first player, and the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys for the second player.\n7.

Run the game:\n   ```\n   java Main\n   ```\n\n## How to Play\n\n- Player 1 controls the left paddle using the 'W' and 'S' keys.\n- Player 2 controls the right paddle using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.\n- The game starts as soon as it is run. Press 'Enter' to pause and unpause the game.\n- A player scores a point when the ball reaches the opponent's end of the screen.\n- The game can be restarted by pausing and then unpausing the game.\n```\n\nPlease note that the `checkCollision()`, `checkScore()`, `keyPressed()`, and `keyReleased()` methods in the `Game` class, and the `update()` method in the `Paddle` class are not fully implemented.
