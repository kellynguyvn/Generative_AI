3. Scoring logic to keep track of points for each player.
4. Collision detection for the ball against the walls and paddles.
5. A simple graphical interface using Java Swing or JavaFX.
6. Controls to start, pause, and restart the game.
7. Multi-threading for smooth gameplay.
8. A README file with instructions on how to run and play the game.

Please provide the complete source code, explanations for each part, and a guide on how to compile and run the game.
